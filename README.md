# Open Science Education

[![Binder]()

**Quick notes**

This material has been prepared for the ESIP Open Data Education Series. We encourage you to run the tutorial by yourself, but please have a look at all the sections below. We appreciate your support and feedback. 

## Abstract

Our goal is to introduce users to the fundamental components that make up Pangeo and to help them envision a workflow that they can port to their own work. We have utilized a workflow of tracking landcover change in Amazon forest. Our second goal is to enable you to run the corresponding notebooks witout any computational investment from your side i.e. completely on public cloud. We will link to public datasets (specifically LandSat) on AWS.


## Description

There are roughhly 10 mudules which are introduced via Jupyter Notebooks. The idea is a user works through them one by one to refresh/exercise the rudimentary concepts, and finally see it utilized in an actual workflow.

`Introduction to Basic Python` is a notebook that describes open source Python packages that have been developed to seamlessly read and process spatio-temporal satellite imagery like Landsat or Sentinel.

The `Introduction to Cloud Computing` is a notebook goes into basics of cloud computing for satellite imagery and procesing. It is written for entry-level folks, and lacks full-depth walk-through.


## Installation notes

**Follow the workshop with just your browser?**   
You can use the "launch binder" link above at the top of this README, which will launch a notebook instance on Binder with all required libraries installed.
