# Building Pathways for Open Science Education using NASA datasets

## Introduction

Here we will create a hypothetical scientific use case: A user wants to use the cloud to analyze change in landcover over a certain region in the Amazon river basin over a period of 20 years.  The goal of this tutorial then is to introduce users to working with NASA satellite imagery and utilizing Amazon Web Services' Open Data program. Through a series of standardized modules, the user is shown an end-to-end workflow for working with satellite imagery. The modules will teach users how to utilize geoscientific Python tools, visualize the data and utilize a parallel computation platform on the cloud (i.e. the Pangeo Platform). 


## Description

The contents of this repository consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks and can be viewed on an open source, free computational platform like Binder. To view the contents of this repo, click the launch binder icon above. 

## Prerequisites
We encourage users to have basic knowledge of Python and Git. The [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/) education materials is a great place to start.
