## Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce users to working with NASA satellite imagery and utilizing Amazon Web Services' Open Data program. Through a series of modules, the user will develop an end-to-end workflow for working with satellite imagery, learn about geoscientific Python tools, and utilize a parallel computation platform on the cloud (i.e. the Pangeo Platform). 

## Description

The contents of this repository consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks and can be viewed on an open source, free computational platform like Binder. To view the contents of this repo, click the launch binder icon above. 


## Installation notes

**Follow the workshop with just your browser?**   
You can use the "launch binder" link above at the top of this README, which will launch a notebook instance on Binder with all required libraries installed.
